WARNING:  This is all lightly tested changes to kernel drivers.  
          Use with extreme caution!  If anyone is interested in adding the
	  necessary extra stuff to integrate these drivers into the kernel
	  module system, feel free to do so.

WARNING:  Installing via `sudo make install` will install new kernel modules!


		Making it work

NOTE:  This has to be done each time you install a new kernel.

0/ Turn off secure kernel mode, if necessary.  In Fedora secure kernel mode
   is set if you use secure UEFI booting, so turn that off.

1/ You may need to have the industrialio and sensor hub kernel modules
   available for the drivers to work.  They were part of Fedora 20, so I
   have never tried to add them in.

2/ Get the kernel-devel and kernel-headers packages for your kernel.  On
   Fedora this is done via
	sudo install kernel-devel
	sudo install kernel-headers
   On some distributions you may also have to install build-essentials

3/ The makefile tries to figure out which distribution it is in and adjust 
KDIR and DDIR accordingly.   For some distribuions modifications may need to
be made.

3/ Compile the modules - there will be warnings
	make

4/ Install the kernel modules
	sudo make install



If you don't want to install new kernel modules you can instead:

Ma/ Blacklist the hid-sensor modules so that the stock ones are not loaded at startup
	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf should look like
blacklist ideapad_laptop
blacklist hid_sensor_hub
blacklist hid_sensor_trigger
blacklist hid_sensor_accel_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_gyro_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_magn_3d
blacklist hid_sensor_als

Mb/ Reboot.  

Mc/Insert the modules, and their dependencies
	sudo modprobe industrialio
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-hub.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-trigger.ko
	sudo modprobe industrialio_triggered_buffer
	sudo modprobe hid_sensor_iio_common
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-accel-3d.ko

Md/ Insert drivers for the other sensors, if desired
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-gyro-3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-magn-3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-als.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-incl-3d.ko
	sudo insmod ./hid-sensor-custom.ko




		Drivers for Sensors

Here are drivers for the Yoga sensors, including the patch to make the hub
work better. 

To install the drivers themselves, just 
   sudo modprobe -r hid-sensor<driver>
   sudo insmod ./hid-sensor<driver>.ko

To get the sensor hub to behave better is more involved, and is described
above.


There are two kinds of drivers

1/ Drivers from 3.14 - these should be good quality
2/ Drivers for the other sensors - these probably need work

The build system is also hacked together and needs to be improved.  Some
include files have been copied into this directory.  This should all be
fixed up.  Some shortcuts had to be made because the common infrastructure
doesn't support these kinds of drivers.


Files for drivers:

hid-sensor-ids.h	From 3.14
hid-ids.h		From 3.14, plus patch to quirk the Yoga sensor
hid-sensor-hub.c	From 3.14, plus patch to quirk the Yoga sensor
 				Also patched to use local hid-sensor-ids.h

hid-sensor-trigger.h	From 3.14
hid-sensor-trigger.c	From 3.14 (had a temporary patch)

hid-sensor-als.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-accel-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-gryo-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-magn-3d.c	From 3.14
hid-sensor-incl-3d.c	From 3.14 (new in 3.14)

hid-sensor-orient.c	
	driver for orientation sensor that reports back a quaternion
	the data is probably wrong here

hid-sensor-custom.c
	driver for custom sensor
	the fields are stolen from other sensors

hid-sensor-generic.c
	driver for generic sensor (only a start)
	the common support can't handle some of the fields of this driver
